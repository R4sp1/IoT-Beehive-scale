### What is it?

  The aim of this graduation work is to manufacture bee hive weight measuring equipment with
  information transfer via Internet of Things network Sigfox. It deals with Internet of Things
  technology, weight sensors, energy saving in battery powered devices, PCB designing in the
  EAGLE program and the production of device to monitor the current weight, temperature and
  humidity inside and around the bee hive. Information processing is provided by
  microcontroller ATmega 328U placed on the Arduino pro mini and programmed in Wiring
  language in Arduino IDE.

### Why is it?

  It is a repository for my high school graduation work and the Czech SOÄŒ competition.
